There are many other command lines options,
which are described further in this document.
.SH WARNING
As Liquid War is a cross-platform program (it also runs on DOS and Windows),
I could reasonably not provide groff UNIX-style documentation to
Windows user. Therefore, Liquid War's documentation is available in many
formats, including HTML, PostScript and PDF. 
.br
I believe these formats are easier to read than this man page.
So check out the 
.B /usr/share/doc/liquidwar 
or 
.B /usr/local/share/doc/liquidwar
directories, for this is
where HTML and other documentation files should be. Otherwise, if 
you are a die-hard man page user, you may continue with this document 8-)
