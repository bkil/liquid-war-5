	This list is for general discussions about Liquid War.
	Here you can make suggestions, submit bug reports, 
	ask for help, find players, etc...	
	Basically, any question or remark which concerns the game
	is welcomed on this list.

	You can't send messages to the list without subscribing.
	The only reason for this is that it's one of the only 
	way to block spam efficiently.
	I first thought it could be OK to allow anyone to post, but
	liquidwar-user seems to have be harvested by robots, so now I
	need to restrict posters. 
	However, I insist on the fact that anyone can subscribe, and
	the subscription to the list is not moderated.
	So if you are a human being and not a stupid spam robot, 
	you're welcome on the list 8-)

    <part title="Web-based chat-box">
      <text>
	I have have set up a web-based chat-box which is accessible here:
	"http://www.ufoot.org/liquidwar/v5/metaserver.php"
      </text>
      <text>
	It's not as good as a good old IRC channel but not everybody can
	use IRC (because of firewalls and the likes), 
	and I like the idea that people
	can chat and have the list of available servers in one single
	web page.

    <part title="IRC channels">
      <text>
	I personnally spend some time on irc.freenode.net so you
	might use it to find other players - though I'm not really
	an IRC addict... ...not yet at least!
      </text>
      <text>
	Here are the channels I recommend:
      </text>
      <list>
	<elem>
	  #liquidwar : Liquid War dedicated channel,
	  to find players and chat while playing.
	</elem>
	<elem>
	  #netgame_players : general channel for players 
	  who want to play Internet games
	  - Free Software and/or Open Source games of course, 
	  we're on freenode.net 8-)
