      Liquid War rules have been invented by
      Thomas Colcombet.
    </text>
    <text>
      He was trying to find algorithms to find the shortest path
      from one point to another, and found the Liquid War
      algorithm. Then it came to his mind that a game could
      be build upon this algorithm, and Liquid War was born.
      He programmed the first two versions of Liquid War
      using Borland Pascal for DOS, and gave me some information
      about the algorithm so that I could re-program it.

      I'm the guy who programmed the latest versions of Liquid War.
      I enhanced the algorithms, and did quite a bunch of work
      to have the game playable by (almost) anyone, that's to
      say create a correct GUI.

      As Liquid War is now free software, protected by the GPL,
      anyone is allowed to view, edit, modify, re-compile
      the source code, and distribute it, as long as Liquid 
      War is still distributed under the GPL.
