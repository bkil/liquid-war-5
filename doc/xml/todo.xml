  <chap title="Bug-fixing">
    <text>
      In its latest releases Liquid War is quite stable IMHO. 
      However there are still some issues with network under Windows
      for instance. I'm aware of these bugs and I'm trying to fix them
      but this does really take time.

      I always welcome bug-reports and patches, as making Liquid War W 5.x.x as
      stable and bug-free as possible is really important to me - and
      most of the time players also appreciate stable programs 8-)

      The most important bug-fixing area is probably cross-platform
      support. That is, make sure that the game runs fine on every
      supported OS. For instance, it's quite common for Mac OS/X and/or
      FreeBSD users to "crash" the game. This rarely happens on
      GNU/Linux, just because it has been so much more tested on
      this platform. This applies to Liquid War itself and also,
      to some extent, to Allegro.

  <chap title="New features">
    <text>
      Let's be clear: no new features in Liquid War 5.
      It's bloated, complicated, old, uninteresting to hack.
      All new features should be found in Liquid War 6.
