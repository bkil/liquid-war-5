  <chap title="Bug-fixing">
    <text>
      In its latest releases Liquid War is quite stable IMHO. 
      However there are still some issues with network under Windows
      for instance. I'm aware of these bugs and I'm trying to fix them
      but this does really take time.

      I always welcome bug-reports and patches, as making Liquid War W 5.x.x as
      stable and bug-free as possible is really important to me - and
      most of the time players also appreciate stable programs 8-)

      It's hard to find people to do that kind of thing.
      Artists are indeed pretty rare, at least artists who wish to
      create stuff freely...
      So if you feel like adding some theme support to Liquid War,
      this could *really* help.
      I used the textures I had but it would be nice
      if one could have a "space" ambiance, an "ocean" ambiance
      or a "desert" ambiance.
      This could really make the game better I think.

      Musics (in midi format) are also appreciated.
      Tim Chadburn spontaneously contributed the first midi files,
      and it really pleased me 8-)

  <chap title="New features">
    <text>
      I regularly receive requests for new features in Liquid War.
      Of course I do not have enough time to implement them all,
      so they land in my "todo" list. However, most "major"
      evolutions are now planned for Liquid War 6, since the code
      in Liquid War 5 is bloated as hell. It's all right to
      debug it and code minor evolutions, but that's all.
    </text>
    <text>
      However, here's a list of what "could be" in the next
      Liquid War 5.x.x releases, although it might never be
      implemented there and come later with Liquid War 6:
    </text>
    <list>
      <elem>
	Network enhancements. Network in LW5 is somewhat buggy and
	hard to use, improvements wouldn't harm.
      </elem>
      <elem>
	Theme support. This would be a way to get rid of the ugly
	current fonts and menus.
      </elem>
    </list>

      Since summer 2005, Liquid War 6, a complete rewrite of Liquid War,
      is on its way. See 
      "http://www.ufoot.org/liquidwar/v6" 
      for more informations.
