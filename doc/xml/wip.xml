      Whenever Liquid War is released, I usually pass
      the good news to Freshmeat
      ( "http://freshmeat.net/projects/liquidwar/" ).
      Then all releases are accessible from the main
      download page, which is "http://www.ufoot.org/liquidwar/v5/download".
    </text>
    <text>
      Releasing the game takes time, for I want all binaries
      to install properly and sources to compile cleanly.
      Therefore there might be some delay before the time
      coding is over and the time a release is actually
      ready.
      So for impatients and/or for people who need to test
      out the very latest versions (eg someone who wants
      to compile the game on a new platform), it's possible
      to access the source repository directly.

  <chap title="About GIT">
    <text>
      Historically, Liquid War has used CVS, GNU Arch (aka tla),
      and now uses git "http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html".
    </text>
    <text>
      So FYI the previously active CVS and GNU Arch repositories, on Sourceforge
      and Savannah, are currently unmaintained.

  <chap title="How to get latest releases">
    <text>
      A typical git command would be:
    </text>
    <code>
git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/liquidwar.git
    </code>
    <text>
     or if you are behind a firewall:
    </text>
    <code>
git clone http://git.savannah.gnu.org/r/liquidwar.git
    </code>
    <text>
      If you are interested, I can open this repository in read/write
      mode, however one of the points of git is that it is distributed and
      allows cooperative developpement with multiple depots, so this isn't
      mandatory. And anyways, importing myself patches received
      by email has never been a real burden.
    </text>
    <text>
      Besides, most developpement is now done on Liquid War 6.
      See "http://www.gnu.org/software/liquidwar6/" or
      "http://www.ufoot.org/liquidwar/v6" for more informations.
