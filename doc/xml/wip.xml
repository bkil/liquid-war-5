      Whenever Liquid War is released, I usually pass
      the good news to Freshmeat
      ( "http://freshmeat.net/projects/liquidwar/" ).
      Then all releases are accessible from the main
      download page, which is "http://www.ufoot.org/liquidwar/v5/download".
    </text>
    <text>
      Releasing the game takes time, for I want all binaries
      to install properly and sources to compile cleanly.
      Therefore there might be some delay before the time
      coding is over and the time a release is actually
      ready.
      So for impatients and/or for people who need to test
      out the very latest versions (eg someone who wants
      to compile the game on a new platform), it's possible
      to access the source repository directly.

  <chap title="About GNU Arch">
    <text>
      I use GNU Arch (Tom Lord's Arch in fact, 
      "http://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-arch/" ) instead of the
      previously used CVS. Indeed, tla has some very fancy features
      such as signing patches with gpg, and I'm tired of suffering
      CVS limitations.
    </text>
    <text>
      So FYI the previously active CVS repositories, on Sourceforge
      and Savannah, are currently unmaintained.

  <chap title="How to get latest releases">
    <list>
      <elem>
	Step 1: read the excellent Arch tutorial
	"http://regexps.srparish.net/www/tutorial/html/arch.html"
	if you are not familiar with tla. I admit there's
	a steep learning curve, but it's yet clear and understandable.
      </elem>
      <elem>
	Step 2: point on my repository, which is accessible (read-only) on
	"http://ufoot.hd.free.fr/depot/pub/2005-freesoftware/liquidwar/".
	Should this address move, try "http://ufoot.hd.free.fr/depot/pub/"
	and browse until you find Liquid War.

      Note that "http://ufoot.hd.free.fr" is a personnal web server
      located in my living room. It uses a simple DSL connection,
      so bandwidth won't be exceptionnally high, and it may suffer
      long and unexpected downtimes.
    </text>
    <text>
      If you are interested, I can open this repository in read/write
      mode, however one of the points of GNU Arch is that it allows
      cooperative developpement with multiple depots, so this isn't
      mandatory. And anyways, importing myself patches received
      by email has never been a real burden.
