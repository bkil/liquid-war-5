This directory contains the files required to set up a meta-server.

I call meta-server the software which I run on my web site to allow the
Liquid War servers to register themselves so that clients can automatically
find out which servers are running in the world.

You might be interested in setting up such a server for yourself, if you
think for instance that the "official" is too slow, not enough reliable etc...
You could also want to have a meta-server running on your LAN, to keep
track of existing servers without informing the whole world about it.
You do not need to do it, since there's a permanent meta-server running
on http://www.ufoot.org. Anyway, I see no reasons not to share this code.

To set up the meta-server, you'll need:
- a working PHP3 capable system. Wether you run it on UNIX or Windows, as an
  Apache module or as a CGI has absolutely no importance. You simply need
  PHP3 pages to work, and must load the MySQL PHP module. I have no idea 
  wether this meta-server would work or not with a PHP4 engine.
- a MySQL server. I believe almost any version of MySQL would fit, since I
  use very basic SQL queries. I would have prefered to run the meta-server on
  PostGreSQL, but my provider only has MySQL installed. So I used it. But
  honestly, I believe any decent SGBD could fit.

Note that the meta-server is not installed when you type "make install" in
the root source directory. If you want to install a meta-server, you'll
need to set up the MySQL database and copy the PHP3 pages yourself.
You'll also probably need to edit the "db.php3" file since it contains the
user and password required to connect to MySQL the server. When you set up 
the php3 server, it is a good idea to make it fetch "/index.php3" when HTTP
clients request "/". This is the default on many PHP3 installs anyway.
