<h1>GP2X Hardware Acceleration in Allegro</h1>

<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>The hardware acceleration in GP2X Allegro is heavily based on
paeryn's code for SDL.  He did all the hard work!

</p><h2>What is accelerated</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Trivial filling operations</strong> - <em>rectfill,
hline, vline, clear_to_color</em> - when applied to a bitmap in
video memory, i.e.  the screen, a video bitmap, or a subbitmap
of either.

</li><li><strong>Blitting operations</strong> - <em>blit, masked_blit,
draw_sprite</em> - where the source and destination are both in
video memory.

</li></ul>

<p>Acceleration is only supported in 8bpp and 16bpp modes; GP2X
Allegro only supports those modes anyway, so that's OK.

</p><p>Allegro uses 5Mb for video memory, and you can set a graphics
mode with any virtual size you like subject to available memory.

</p><p>To take advantage of hardware accelerated blitting, it's
easiest to use video bitmaps.  First create one the size of the
visible screen (SCREEN_W x SCREEN_H), then use show_video_bitmap
to ensure the screen is scrolled properly, and do all your
drawing there.  Then create additional video bitmaps for your
sprites, etc, and use blit or draw_sprite as normal to draw them
to your primary video bitmap.

</p><p>You can combine that with page flipping by creating two
screen-sized video bitmaps, and drawing to one while the other
is visible, swapping which is which each frame.


</p><h2>Hardware Scrolling</h2>

<p>If you're not using video bitmaps, you can scroll the visible
screen around the virtual screen, but there's a 32-bit granularity so
you're restricted to even X coordinates in 16bpp or multiples of
4 in 8bpp.

</p><p>It's not trivial to combine this with using video bitmaps,
though it can be done.


</p><h2>Example - Parallax Demo</h2>

<p>I've uploaded an example which uses page flipped video
bitmaps to take advantage of the hardware acceleration.  It
draws lots of layers of random pipe-like tiles, using
accelerated masked blits or sprites or something, I don't
totally remember!
