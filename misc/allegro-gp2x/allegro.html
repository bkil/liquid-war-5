<h1>GP2X Allegro v0.3</h1>

<p><em><a href="mailto:gfoot@users.sf.net">by George Foot</a></em>

</p><p>I've ported Allegro to the GP2X.  Thanks must go to rlyeh,
whose "minimal" library was a great reference for
setting the video mode beyond what fbdev can do, and paeryn,
whose 2D acceleration routines in SDL provided the basis of the
routines Allegro is using now.

<p><strong>If you don't know Allegro</strong>, but want to
learn, have a look around the website, and get the main
distribution and install it on your dev PC.  You might want to
get a zip version instead of the .tar.gz linked above, if you're
using Windows.  Then get the binary archive above, and use that
when developing for GP2X.  Use the documentation from the core
Allegro distribution, which gets built in various formats as
part of the build process.

</p><p><strong>If you know Allegro</strong> and just want to develop
for the GP2X, you can just get the binary package - it includes
all the headers too, but no docs.  Use the documentation from
core Allegro, which you'll probably want to install on your dev
PC anyway as above (if you haven't already got it).

</p><p><strong>If you're an advanced user</strong> who might want to
hack the library itself, you'll need the original sources and my
patches, but not the binary archive.  It's not too hard to <a href="http://www.glost.eclipse.co.uk/gfoot/gp2x/allegro-building.html">build it yourself</a>.
