<h1>Pre-built GP2X Allegro v0.3</h1>

<p><em><a href="mailto:gfoot@users.sf.net">by George Foot</a></em>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is aimed at Windows users who lack the software to
crosscompile Unix Allegro themselves.  It's particularly aimed
at devkitGP2X users, but it may also work with other toolchains,
if they are sufficiently advanced; the GPH toolchain is not
advanced though, so don't use that.


<h2>Download</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href="gp2xallegro-0.3.zip">gp2xallegro-0.3.zip</a> - 1.6Mb
</ul>
<p>I'd recommend also installing Allegro 4.2.0, as that's what this is based on - then you'll have the docs and examples, not to mention the ability to test your games on your PC!

</ul>


<h2>Installing</h2>

<p>You can install this wherever you like, including into your
devkitGP2X directories.  You need to edit the
gp2x-allegro-config script, in the bin directory, and set the
prefix to the parent of the bin directory.  You may want to add
the bin directory to your path.
