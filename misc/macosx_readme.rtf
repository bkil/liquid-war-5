\f0\fs24 \cf0 Liquid War Client\
\
Requirements:\
	Mac OS X ( Tested with 10.2.4 )\
	X Server ( Tested with Apple's X11 Beta and XDarwin )\
	ESound ( Only needed for sound. Available from Fink )\
\
This is application bundle attempts to detect if the X server and esd are running.  If not, it will try to start them before running Liquid War.  This works on my computer, there's no guarantee it will work on yours.  If you have problems, try manually starting esd and X.  Sometimes there seems to be a delay between launching X and launching Liquid War.  Moving the mouse around and clicking on the menu bar usually make Liquid War start.  Sometimes there will be no sound even though esd is running.  I have no clue why.  \
