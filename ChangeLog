	still rather segfault prone for now.

	* Added a "random map" button.

	fast servers from slow ones.

	* Added Ryan D. Brown in the credits.

	* Passed all the C source through GNU indent.

	HTTP 1.1.

	* Applied new German translations by Jan Gretschuskin.

	* Fixed a bug which caused player names to be blank in score screen.

	* Fixed ugly bug in srvchan.c, which caused network to be completely
	broken (bug introduced by previous code cleanup).

	* Changed the serialization method for maps, so that the game can be
	used in a networked environnement even if some machines are big-endian
	and other ones are little-endian. This is an endianness fix, which 
	should hopefully make network available on Mac OS X.

	* The source now compiles with "-W" gcc option under Linux.


2003-02-21  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	native snprintf support. That is -> windows. No wonder they get so 
	many buffer oveflows and security holes ;-P

	* Added a dtd to the xml documentation. This is cleaner, and Emacs
	stops complaining about "missing file entity" when I open source
	files 8-)

	* Added a "CPU vs human" option which allows players to specify
	wether the CPUs should always attack humans or not.


2003-01-02  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Added 3 maps contributed by Rene Stach.

	* Replaced "License" by its traductions in French and German in the
	"about" screen.

	* Fixed an old bug in texture reading and color converting, related
	to the use of the rand() function. This bug could cause compilation

	* Added automatic detection of pthread_create in libpthread. Used to
	switch on the -pthread option instead of -lpthread on FreeBSD.


2002-10-11  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)
	
	* Added GNU Make automatic detection in configure scripts, for systems
	that have both make (non-GNU) and gmake (GNU) commands, such as
	FreeBSD.

	* Replaced "test x == y" by "test x = y" in the configure script,
	since this should work better with shells like csh (FreeBSD).

	* It's now possible to specify which "make" command to use by
	exporting the environnement var "MAKE" before typing ./configure.
	Usefull for compiling the game when GNU Make is called gmake for
	instance (think of FreeBSD...).
	
	* Added German language support. Translation by Jan Gretschuskin.


2002-09-02  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Bug-fix in the global exit function (minor bug in debug-mode, when

	* Released 5.5.7

	* The "big data allocation" is now called to automatically double

	and the buffer was to small - this previously resulted in a 
	pathetic almost useless error message...
	
	* Added more settings for the "min map resolution" feature.

	* Applied patch from Eugene St Leger. Now the menu water volume is
	correctly saved in the config file.


2002-08-30  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)
	
	* Added the feature suggested by Thomas Harte, which is to magnify
	small maps so that they are more interesting to play on fast computer.
	It's still possible to use the original small versions however.

	* Fixed a minor checksum verification bug


2002-08-29  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Added the possibility to compile the game in debug mode under
	UNIX.

	* Moved the "Cursor speed" option back in the "Rules" menu, and

	all the parameters, such as player names for instance...


2002-08-28  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Bug-fix in the core algorithm, concerning fighters moving in
	the south-west direction. This direction was simply not correctly
	handled 8-(

	* Increased server messages consistency. Code cleanup.

	* Fixed a minor bug in the core algorithm (mesh was not spread
	correctly in the top-left corner of the map).
	
	* Added a function to dump rules config on stdout.

	* Fixed a bug concerning the famous "error processing WHO 0"
	message. This should - finally - fix the problem of unwanted
	client disconnections. At least I hope so...


2002-08-26  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Minor network fixes

	* Updated the mpeg tools.

	* Minor changes in the meta-server.


2002-08-08  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Changed the French language detection under UNIX

	* Fixed a minor menu issue in the French version (game and menu water
	labels had been inverted).

	
2002-07-27  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Add 18 and 25 frames/sec display limits, to make more sensible movie
	captures.
	

2002-07-18  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Released 5.5.6.


2002-07-17  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Little tweak in the cursor move fonction which makes walls more
	slippery. Moving cursors should be easier now.

	* Enhanced the "Default" options button, so that settings such as
	fullscreen mode are immediately applied.
	
	* Fixed a bug in datafile maps writing/reading. The "size" field which
	was believed by network to be the size of maps was the size of the
	background. In practice, size is always > bg_size but this was weird
	anyway...
	
	* Fixed a bug in the network map exchange (potential buffer overflow
	to be very precise)
	
	* The game now performs a range check on all the config parameters
	retrieved from the network.
	
	* Added 4 "World" maps

	* Fixed a bug which disabled asm assembly by default. Not in 5.5.5.

	* Release 5.5.5.


2002-07-16  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Pressing <ENTER> in the edit zone in the connection screem
	causes the message to be sent.

	* The "capture" mode can now be activated from teh command line.

	* Added a "tombola" mode where the score menu displays a random
	number between 1 - 500 instead of the scores. Rather specific
	and unusual stuff indeed 8-)


2002-07-14  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Added a module to capture the video output and dump it on the disk.

	* F10 now exits the game "right away" without prompting for anything.

	* Disabled the possibility to pause the game during a network session.

	* Changed the way lag keys are sent. Should work a little better.

	* Added a "struct alignment" verification code so that if a compiler
	generates different struct sizes/alignements, then Liquid War detects
	it and does not use the i386 assembly code...

	* Changed the way network colors are automatically attributed. It's
	not random anymore, the game tries to pick colors that are as
	different as possible from already enrolled colors.


2002-07-13  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Added a "checksum" system to check that the game behaves the same 
	on every computer in network games. Seems to prove the game is still
	not bug free 8-( This feature is not in 5.5.4.

	* Added password support. This feature is not in 5.5.4.

	* The game now plays a sound when another player joins a network game.
	This feature is not in 5.5.4.

	* Moved the "check_loose_team" function from "display" to "logic".
	This could cause severe inconsistencies in network bugs when there
	were more than 2 players involved. This bug-fix is not in 5.5.4.

	* Updated the meta-server so that it can handle U61 requests. Not
	really related to Liquid War anyway 8-)

	* Added the possibility to abort the connection on a server. This 
	could indeed take a bunch of time since connect is a blocking call
	which can take up to a minute before failing... Not in 5.5.4 either...

	* Released 5.5.4.


2002-07-12  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Fixed a bug in the "rules" menu display. Game time was broken.

	* Small network fix on the server.

	* The "Play" button is now disabled in the "Connect" screen once one
	has pressed "Start now" or "Play". This fixes a rather annoying bug,
	since when people pressed "Start" twice they would sometime get
	weird "Network errors", which totally super sucked...

	* Added calls to "yeild_timeslice" to make LW more
	"multitasking-friendly"

	* Fixed an ugly UNIX X-Windows related bug. When switching between
	workspaces, edit boxes and in a general manner all buffered input
	would pathetically fail.

	* Little RPM generation update, to solve a man page compression issue.
	

2002-07-11  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Released 5.5.3.


2002-07-10  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* French support is now auto-detected under Windows too.

	* Added informations about my GnuPG public key.
	

2002-07-09  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Added a new map (contributed by "Mouse")

	* Changed the way liquidwarmap works. Wall color is now given by the
	top left pixel and is not supposed tobe "index 0" anymore.

	* Added an ugly but usefull hack/script in the misc section, which
	helps formatting contributed .bmp files so that they are correctly
	handled by the liquidwarmap utility.

	* lwwin.exe now has a "built-in" icon.

	* renamed copying.txt to license.txt in DOS and Win releases


2002-07-08  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Fixed a bug on the server -> disconnection of clients while sending
	game information was not handled correctly.

	* Added a small - yet working - chat system in the connection screen.

	
2002-07-02  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Added 6 maps by Jan Gretschuskin


2002-07-01  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Fixed a score bug (some teams would be considered as playing while 
	they were inactive).


2002-06-29  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Released 5.5.2


2002-06-28  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Separated run-time (network fetched for instance) config 
	parameters from the config parameters stored in the config file.

	* Added an "Assembly or standard C" option in the advanced rules
	menu. This allow players to switch off assembly code if they want
	to. Mostly for testing though...

	* Changed the resolution of the default map, which was too small
	IMHO. The old one is still here anyway 8-)


2002-06-27  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Bug-fix concerning display in page flipping mode

	* Removed a bunch of Windows specific quirks

	* Finally enabled all the assembly code under Windows (BTW, I
	confirm - once again - that MSVC is a total piece of crap)

	* Rewrote the "set_resolution" function in a cleaner way

	* Separate config and log files for the Windows & DOS binaries

	* Moved the icons to the "misc" directory, and added a 32x32 xpm


2002-06-26  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Re-enabled the assembly code for the "wave effects"

	* Changed the way the "Viewport" size is calculated.
	

2002-06-25  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Liquid War now handles the "Close" button in windowed context.
	(MS-Windows and X-Windows).
	

2002-06-24  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* The "control_type" parameter is now transmitted on the nwtwork.
	This enables the client to know if a network team is a bot, and also
	fixes a network bug (when the "CPU Strength" parameter was changed).

	* Re-enabled some i386 assembly code under Linux


2002-06-21  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* The options are now chosen by the _first_ connected client.


2002-06-20  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Bug-fix concerning language detection on Linux, submitted by 
	David Turner (the game would segfault if LANG was undefined)
	Patch not included in 5.5.1.

	* Minor bug-fix in the metaserver (age was wrong when > 1 day)

	* Released 5.5.1


2002-06-19  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Minor fixes

	* Replaced truecolor custom/map/pacman.bmp by a 256 colors indexed
	version (fixes a DOS bug)

	* Added informations about IRC 


2002-06-18  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Bug-fixes concerning custom levels loading

	* Network bug-fix concerning disconnection at game start
	

2002-06-10  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Better error handling on the server, especially when sending info
	to clients before a game starts.

	* Fixed the http client parser (would not handle correctly IP adresses
	which had 15 characters.

	* Bug-fix in the meta-server (chat messages)
	

2002-06-06  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Applied patch sent by Colin Stewart on dnsutil.c (the game would
	not compile on Debian Potato).

	
2002-06-04  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Fixed some custom ressources stuff. 

	* Released 5.5.0
	
	
2002-06-03  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Fixed a "color" bug which occured with 6 teams in a network game. 
	
	* Fixed some DOS and Windows bugs

	* Updated the docs.


2002-05-31  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Changed the way network sockets are closed

	* The server is now able to tell the clients that is is "full"
	and therefore does not accept any more teams.

	* Added date and time to the server log.
	

2002-05-30  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Added a "chat" functionnality to the meta-server
	
	* Finished the French menus


2002-05-29  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Finally fixed the ugly mouse bug which caused the mouse to leave
	a "trace" on some screens.

	* In a network game, it's now the first connected players who
	chooses which level will be played - the choice used to be done
	by the last connected player.
	

2002-05-28  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Bug-fix in the DNS lookup routine


2002-05-27  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Implemented a new "Connect" menu which displays who's currently
	connected on the server.

	* Added the possibility to start a game even not all the players
	are connected yet.

	* The server is now able to disconnect a player while waiting for
	others to connect.


2002-05-20  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Added clarity.mid and return.mid (composed by Tim Chadburn)


2002-05-17  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Added a "Copying" section to the docs.


2002-05-14  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* All the labels but the log messages are supported in French.


2002-05-10  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* More locale stuff...


2002-05-07  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Added some new French menu labels.


2002-05-06  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Added a "memset(d,0,sizeof(d))" call at the beginning of every
	menu. Should prevent from some random GUI errors.

	* The mouse cursor is now hidden during the game
	
	* Added player name support in the "Scores" menu. Works in both
	network and local modes.

	
2002-05-04  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Updated the "Teams" menu. As suggested by Frode Haugsgjerd, the 
	"Human/Cpu" choice has been replaced by a "Human/Cpu/Off" choice.
	A player name has also been added - however it's not used yet.
	
	* Removed the "NICKNAME" from network code, which is useless since
	player names are about to be implemented.

	* Added a "Controls" menu to set up the joystick state and the mouse
	sensibility. This was previously in the "Teams" menu.


2002-04-29  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Removed the "in-game" help which was outdated anyway...


2002-04-27  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Removed the "Help" button and replaced it with a "play" button.

	* Added a "Language" menu.


2002-04-23  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Updated the "about" menu.


2002-04-22  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Updated the php3 doc generator.

	* Minor fix in configure.in.

	
2002-04-02  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Added fodder.mid, composed by Tim Chadburn.

	* Added Tim Chadburn's documentation about OSS midi.
	

2002-03-21  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Implemented a meta-server in PHP3, which registers servers.
	A new menu has been added to the client so that players can
	automatically pick a server.


2002-03-15  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Added information about the mailing-list


2002-03-14  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Quick hack to fix a MIDI initialization problem


2002-03-13  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Added marauder.mid (by Tim Chadburn) to the musics.


2002-03-12  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* Fixed RPM/install-info related bugs.


2002-03-11  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)
	
	* Version 5.4.5 rleased

	* Added midi music support. Midi files contributed by Tim Chadburn.

	* Fixed an install-info related bug in the RPM file

	* The Windows version now outputs stuff to a data/lw.log file


2002-02-25  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* version 5.4.4 released

	* Changed the copyright notice at the beginning of each file so
	that it's conform to the GPL's suggestions.

	* Added a time limit in the keyboard polling which is used in the
	"teams" menu. Should prevent the game from freezing.

	* Fixed a serious bug in key choosing in the "teams" menu. This
	bug had not been reported 8-(

	* Added documentation in "info" format.

	* ./configure now autodetects tools such as PDFLaTeX, and the
	Makefile won't try to build such doc if it's not available.

	* It's now possible to compile an optimized version of Liquid War
	(for i686 for instance) using ./configure --target=xxx. 

	* Various bug-fixes and enhancements in the ./configure script
	and in the makefiles.


2002-01-28  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* version 5.4.3 released

	* Bug-fix in the liquidwarmap utility (some maps could generate
	protection faults while compiling).

	* Bug-fix in the datafile generation (the background image palette
	was wrecked with Allegro 4.0).

	* LW is now compliant with the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard, this
	implies that binaries are in $prefix/games.

	* There's now a window title which says "Liquid War 5.4.3"

	* Added a windowed/fullscreen mode support.

	* Limited the size of "mesh elements" to 8x8 to avoid weird behaviors
	on very big and empty maps.

	* Added an uninstall target

	* Added some basic scripts to automatically build the various releases

	* Added a liquidwar.spec file so that it's easy to build a rpm
	

2001-07-23  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* version 5.4.2 released

	* Bug-fix in the network code.

	* A few more levels.


2001-07-18  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* version 5.4.1 released

	* Fixed many bugs in the network support, and added the "-lag"
	option to the server. Basically it should be possible to play
	on Internet now. Also, the client now displays readable error
	messages when there's a problem joining the server.

	* Added names to maps so that it's easier to choose them,
	added a "speeds" and changed some other GUI related stuff.

	* The default memory allocated (8192Kb) has also been increased
	(16384Kb) so that the game can handle big maps. 2 new hudge
	maps have been added.


2001-07-07  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* version 5.4.0 released

	* The *big* change is that with this release Liquid War includes
	network support. There are probably some bugs left and some minor
	features are missing, but basically, one can play on a LAN.

	* The other important point is that the documentation is back -
	it had been lost when I had changed my web site - and is available
	in several formats (HTML, plain text, PostScript and PDF).

	* I also separated the Windows and DOS packages since the DOS .exe
	is quite big and most of the time useless to Windows users since
	DOS support in recent versions of Windows is getting worse and
	worse.


2001-03-18  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* version 5.3.3 released

	* Fixed some minor bugs which were revealed when creating the
	Debian package for Liquid War.

	* I also prepared a statically linked version of the game. This
	version installs itself in no time on almost any recent GNU/Linux box,
	so it's an interesting point for GNU/Linux users which do not feel
	like spending 3 hours compiling the game before being able
	to try it out.


2000-06-19  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* version 5.3.2 released

	* I changed the textures in the datafile and replaced the existing
	textures by textures I imported from the Gimp. This is for copyright
	issues since I can not find the author of the previous textures
	any more and would normally require his acceptance of my putting
	his textures in my GPL'ed game. So with Gimp's textures I'm pretty
	sure that I won't have any copyright problem.

	* I also started to comment the source files.


2000-04-09  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* version 5.3.1 released

	* I changed the GNU/Linux configure script so that it searches for
	dat (the allegro datafile compiler). The reason is that several
	players could not install LW because of this (they had downloaded
	the end-user version of Allegro but the full-version is needed).

	* I updated the GNU/Linux version so that it has all the features of
	the old dos version (including the "wave effect").

	* A starter kit has been prepared, it a lighter version with a 
	pred-built light datafile.It makes it easier to download LW
	quickly and try it out before downloading the full version.
	This implies that now one can use datafiles with any number
	of textures and maps.

	* I prepared binary packages for DOS & Windows (the windows version
	is *still* not very stable).

	* Added a button in the wave menu to toggle the wave effect without
	pressing F4 during gameplay.

	* Some bug fixing.


2000-03-12  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* version 5.3.0 released

	* All further major developpements of LW will be done from GNU/Linux.

	* I now use a unix style x.x.x numbering system for versions.

	* Liquid War is on sourceforge.net

	* I prepared scripts and changed the directory structure of the
	project, so that LW can be installed under GNU/Linux with standard
	commands like './configure;make;make install'

	* Many small bugs have been fixed.


1999-09-06  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* version 5.2 released

	* Liquid War is now released under the GNU General Public Licencse.

	* Some improvements such as a 'frame per second limit' which limits
	the time taken by display operations so that the game is globally
	faster.

	* I release the first windows executable of Liquid War, it's not very
	stable but basically works.

	* Soon after, Peter Wang gives me patches to have LW run under GNU/Linux.

1998-11-21  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* version 5.1 released

	* Small bug fixes, changed some menus.


1998-09-26  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* version 5.0 released

	* Everything has been rewritten
	DJGPP used instead of Borland C/C++
	Allegro is used as a wrapper for ease of developpement and future
  	portability
	Optimization of the algorithm
	Visual enhancements such as the "wave effect"
	An 'understandable' GUI replaces the old cryptic one.


1995-07-01  Christian Mauduit (ufoot@ufoot.org)

	* version 3.0 released

	* built with borlandc++ 3.0, barely usable.
