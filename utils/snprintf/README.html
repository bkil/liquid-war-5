<h1><b>snprintf.c</b>
<br> - a portable implementation of snprintf,
<br><font size="+1">including
vsnprintf.c, asnprintf, vasnprintf, asprintf, vasprintf</font>
</h1>

<p><b>snprintf</b> is a routine to convert numeric and string arguments
to formatted strings. It is similar to sprintf(3) provided in a
system's C library, yet it requires an additional argument - the buffer
size - and it guarantees never to store anything beyond the given buffer,
regardless of the format or arguments to be formatted. Some newer
operating systems do provide <b>snprintf</b> in their C library,
but many do not or do provide an inadequate (slow or idiosyncratic)
version, which calls for a portable implementation of this routine.

</p><h2>Terms and conditions ...</h2>

<p>This program is free software; it is dual licensed, the terms of the
"Frontier Artistic License" or the "GNU General Public License"
can be chosen at your discretion. The chosen license then applies
solely and in its entirety. Both licenses come with this Kit.

</p><h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>careful adherence to specs regarding flags, field width and precision;
</li><li>good performance for large string handling (large format, large argument
or large paddings). Performance is similar to system's <b>sprintf</b>
and in several cases significantly better (make sure you compile with
optimizations turned on, tell the compiler the code is strict ANSI
if necessary to give it more freedom for optimizations);
</li><li>return value semantics per ISO/IEC 9899:1999 ("ISO C99");
</li><li>written in standard ISO/ANSI C - requires an ANSI C compiler.
</li></ul>

<h2>Supported conversion specifiers and data types</h2>

<p>This <b>snprintf</b> only supports the following conversion specifiers:
s, c, d, o, u, x, X, p  (and synonyms: i, D, U, O - see below)
with flags: '-', '+', ' ', '0' and '#'.
An asterisk is supported for field width as well as precision.

</p><p>Length modifiers 'h' (<i>short int</i>), 'l' (<i>long int</i>),
and 'll' (<i>long long int</i>) are supported.

</p><p>NOTE:
</p><blockquote>
If macro SNPRINTF_LONGLONG_SUPPORT is not defined (default)
the length modifier 'll' is recognized but treated the same as 'l',
which may cause argument value truncation!
Defining SNPRINTF_LONGLONG_SUPPORT requires that your system's
<b>sprintf</b> also handles length modifier 'll'.
<i>long long int</i> is a language extension which may not be portable.
</blockquote>

<p>Conversion of numeric data (conversion specifiers d, o, u, x, X, p)
with length modifiers (none or h, l, ll) is left to the system
routine <b>sprintf</b>, but all handling of flags, field width and precision
as well as c and s conversions is done very carefully by this portable routine.
If a string precision (truncation) is specified (e.g. %.8s) it is
guaranteed the string beyond the specified precision will not be referenced.

</p><p>Length modifiers h, l and ll are ignored for c and s conversions
(data types <i>wint_t</i> and <i>wchar_t</i> are not supported).

</p><p>The following common synonyms for conversion characters are supported:
</p><ul>
<li>i is a synonym for d
</li><li>D is a synonym for ld, explicit length modifiers are ignored
</li><li>U is a synonym for lu, explicit length modifiers are ignored
</li><li>O is a synonym for lo, explicit length modifiers are ignored
</li></ul>
The D, O and U conversion characters are nonstandard, they are supported
for backward compatibility only, and should not be used for new code.

<p>The following is specifically <b>not</b> supported:
</p><ul>
<li>flag ' (thousands' grouping character) is recognized but ignored
</li><li>numeric conversion specifiers: f, e, E, g, G and synonym F,
as well as the new a and A conversion specifiers
</li><li>length modifier 'L' (<i>long double</i>)
and 'q' (<i>quad</i> - use 'll' instead)
</li><li>wide character/string conversions: lc, ls, and nonstandard
synonyms C and S
</li><li>writeback of converted string length: conversion character n
</li><li>the n$ specification for direct reference to n-th argument
</li><li>locales
</li></ul>

<p>It is permitted for str_m to be zero, and it is permitted to specify NULL
pointer for resulting string argument if str_m is zero (as per ISO C99).

</p><p>The return value is the number of characters which would be generated
for the given input, <i>excluding</i> the trailing null. If this value
is greater or equal to str_m, not all characters from the result
have been stored in str, output bytes beyond the (str_m-1) -th character
are discarded. If str_m is greater than zero it is guaranteed
the resulting string will be null-terminated.

</p><p>NOTE that this matches the ISO C99, OpenBSD, and GNU C library 2.1,
but is different from some older and vendor implementations,
and is also different from XPG, XSH5, SUSv2 specifications.
For historical discussion on changes in the semantics and standards
of snprintf see printf(3) man page in the Linux programmers manual.

</p><p>Routines asprintf and vasprintf return a pointer (in the ptr argument)
to a buffer sufficiently large to hold the resulting string. This pointer
should be passed to free(3) to release the allocated storage when it is
no longer needed. If sufficient space cannot be allocated, these functions
will return -1 and set ptr to be a NULL pointer. These two routines are a
GNU C library extensions (glibc).

</p><p>Routines asnprintf and vasnprintf are similar to asprintf and vasprintf,
yet, like snprintf and vsnprintf counterparts, will write at most str_m-1
characters into the allocated output string, the last character in the
allocated buffer then gets the terminating null. If the formatted string
length (the return value) is greater than or equal to the str_m argument,
the resulting string was truncated and some of the formatted characters
were discarded. These routines present a handy way to limit the amount
of allocated memory to some sane value.

</p><h2>Known problems with the latest version 2.2</h2>

Please add the following two <tt>#include</tt> directives
to file <i>snprintf.h</i> if your compiler complains:
<blockquote>
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;<br>
#include &lt;stdarg.h&gt;
</blockquote>

Only if using <i>test.c</i>, please replace the line 266:
<blockquote>
    assert(str_full[sizeof(str_full)-1] == '\0');
</blockquote>
in file <i>test.c</i>, with:
<blockquote>
    assert(str_full[len1f] == '\0');
</blockquote>

<p>(Thanks to <a href="http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/u/tuturune/">Tuomo
A Turunen</a> for reporting the later problem.)

</p><p>This will be fixed in the next version.


</p><h2>Revision history</h2>

<p><b>Version 1.3 fixes a runaway loop problem from 1.2. Please upgrade.</b>
<br><b>Version 2.2 fixes a potential %c conversion problem
present in all previous versions.</b>

</p><dl><dt>1999-06-30	V1.3  Mark Martinec &lt;mark.martinec@ijs.si&gt;
</dt><dd><ul>
<li>fixed runaway loop (eventually crashing when str_l wraps
  beyond 2^31) while copying format string without
  conversion specifiers to a buffer that is too short
  (thanks to Edwin Young &lt;edwiny@autonomy.com&gt; for spotting the problem);
</li><li>added macros PORTABLE_SNPRINTF_VERSION_(MAJOR|MINOR) to snprintf.h
</li></ul>

</dd><dt>2000-02-14	V2.0 (never released) Mark Martinec &lt;mark.martinec@ijs.si&gt;
</dt><dd><ul>
<li>relaxed license terms:
  <a href="http://www.ijs.si/software/snprintf/LICENSE.txt">The Artistic License</a> now applies.
  You may still apply the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
  as was distributed with previous versions, if you prefer;
</li><li>changed REVISION HISTORY dates to use
  <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/%7Emgk25/iso-time.html">ISO 8601
  date format</a>;
</li><li>added vsnprintf (patch also independently proposed by
  Caolán McNamara 2000-05-04, and Keith M Willenson 2000-06-01)
</li></ul>

</dd><dt>2000-06-27	V2.1  Mark Martinec &lt;mark.martinec@ijs.si&gt;
</dt><dd><ul>
<li>removed POSIX check for str_m &lt; 1; value 0 for str_m is
  allowed by ISO C99 (and GNU C library 2.1) (pointed out
  on 2000-05-04 by Caolán McNamara, caolan@ csn dot ul dot ie).
  Besides relaxed license this change in standards adherence
  is the main reason to bump up the major version number;
</li><li>added nonstandard routines asnprintf, vasnprintf, asprintf,
  vasprintf that dynamically allocate storage for the
  resulting string; these routines are not compiled by default,
  see comments where NEED_V?ASN?PRINTF macros are defined;
</li><li>autoconf contributed by Caolán McNamara
</li></ul>

</dd><dt>2000-10-06	V2.2  Mark Martinec &lt;mark.martinec@ijs.si&gt;
</dt><dd><ul>
<li><b>BUG FIX</b>: the %c conversion used a temporary variable
  that was no longer in scope when referenced,
  possibly causing incorrect resulting character;
</li><li>BUG FIX: make precision and minimal field width unsigned
  to handle huge values (2^31 &lt;= n &lt; 2^32) correctly;
  also be more careful in the use of signed/unsigned/size_t
  internal variables -- probably more careful than many
  vendor implementations, but there may still be a case
  where huge values of str_m, precision or minimal field
  could cause incorrect behaviour;
</li><li>use separate variables for signed/unsigned arguments,
  and for short/int, long, and long long argument lengths
  to avoid possible incompatibilities on certain
  computer architectures. Also use separate variable
  arg_sign to hold sign of a numeric argument,
  to make code more transparent;
</li><li>some fiddling with zero padding and "0x" to make it
  Linux compatible;
</li><li>systematically use macros fast_memcpy and fast_memset
  instead of case-by-case hand optimization; determine some
  breakeven string lengths for different architectures;
</li><li>terminology change: <i>format</i> -&gt; <i>conversion specifier</i>,
  <i>C9x</i> -&gt; <i>ISO/IEC 9899:1999 ("ISO C99")</i>,
  <i>alternative form</i> -&gt; <i>alternate form</i>,
  <i>data type modifier</i> -&gt; <i>length modifier</i>;
</li><li>several comments rephrased and new ones added;
</li><li>make compiler not complain about 'credits' defined but
  not used;
</li></ul>

<h2>Other implementations of snprintf</h2>

<p>I am aware of some other (more or less) portable implementations
of <b>snprintf</b>. I do not claim they are free software - please refer

written by Bjorn Reese
&lt;<a href="mailto:breese@mail1.stofanet.dk">breese@mail1.stofanet.dk</a>&gt;
and Daniel Stenberg &lt;daniel at haxx.se&gt;. Trio fully implements
the C99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999) and UNIX98 (the Single Unix Specification,
Version 2) standards, as well as many features from other implemenations,
e.g. the GNU libc and BSD4. See <a href="http://www.contactor.se/%7Edast/trio/">http://www.contactor.se/~dast/trio/</a>

ecvt(3), fcvt(3) and gcvt(3) from the standard C library
or from the GNU libc.

<br>This is from the code:
